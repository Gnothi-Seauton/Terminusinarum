香港——学生们在学期结束时买好了回家的票，盼望着考试后轻松一下，回中国偏远的西部地区与家人欢聚度夏。

然而，他们却在不久后被告知，他们的父母不在家，亲戚们已经失踪，邻居们也不见了——这些人都被关进了拘禁营，这个为关押穆斯林少数民族而建的拘禁营网正在扩大。

新疆地方当局对这种危险的局面颇为担心。所以他们做好了准备。

自治区领导把一份内部指示下达给地方官员，建议他们，放假的学生一回来就尽快与他们见面，不让他们发声。这份指示包括令人不寒而栗的官僚指南，教官员们如何应对令学生痛苦的问题，第一个最明显的问题是：我家人在哪里？

“他们在政府设立的培训学校，” 指南中的回答这样开始。如果学生追问的话，指南叫官员告诉学生，他们的亲属不是罪犯——但现在不能离开这些 “学校”。

这个问答形式的指示中还有一个几乎不加掩饰的威胁：学生们会被告知，他们的行为可能缩短或延长家人被拘禁的时间。“我想你会支持他们，这是为了他们好，” 指示建议官员这样说，“也是为了你好。”

这份指示是《纽约时报》获得的 403 页内部文件之一。它们是数十年来从中国执政的共产党内部泄露出来的最大一批政府文件，为人们了解在新疆的持续镇压提供了前所未有的内部材料。在过去三年里，当局已将多达 100 万名维吾尔族、哈萨克族和其他少数民族的人关进了拘禁营和监狱。

中共已驳斥了国际社会对拘禁营的批评，中国把拘禁营描述为使用温和手段打击伊斯兰极端主义的就业培训中心。但这些内部文件通过策划和精心安排这场镇压的官员们使用的语言和命令，证实了这项行动的强制性。

在政府向公众展示其新疆工作是慈善的、稀松平常的同时，也在这些内部文件中讨论并组织了一场无情且惊人的运动。文件记录了中共高层领导人对极端主义暴力采取严厉和紧急行动的命令，包括大规模拘禁，也记录了他们在讨论镇压后果时的漠然态度。

报告提到，孩子看到他们的父母被带走，学生想知道谁来支付他们的学费，由于缺乏劳动力，农作物无法种植或收割。然而，官员们接到的指示是，告诉那些抱怨的人，要感谢共产党的帮助，保持沉默。

这些泄露出来的文件为人们提供了一幅异乎寻常的内幕，展示了隐蔽的中国国家机器，怎样执行自毛泽东时代以来中国影响最广泛的拘禁行动。文件中披露的关键信息包括：

*   中国国家主席、中共中央总书记习近平，在对官员们发表了的一系列内部讲话中，为镇压打下基础。这些讲话是习近平在 2014 年 4 月视察新疆期间和之后发表的，就在他去新疆的几周前，维族武装分子在一个火车站用刀砍了 150 多人，造成 31 人死亡。习近平要求全面开展 “反恐怖、反渗透、反分裂” 的斗争，使用“专政机关”，“毫不留情”。
    

*   海外的恐怖袭击和美国从阿富汗撤军，加剧了中国领导层的担忧，影响了镇压行动的展开。中国官员认为，英国发生的袭击事件是 “过分强调‘人权高于安全’” 的后果，习近平主张中共模仿美国在 9·11 袭击事件后 “反恐战争” 的一些做法。
    
*   自治区新党委书记陈全国于 2016 年 8 月上任后特别积极，新疆的拘禁营迅速扩大。为表明这场运动的正确性，陈全国把习近平的讲话分发给官员们，敦促他们 “应收尽收”。
    

*   镇压行动遭到了当地干部的怀疑和抵制，他们担心这会加剧民族紧张局势，扼杀经济增长。陈全国对此的反应，是清除了一批有妨碍他工作之嫌的干部，其中包括一名县级领导官员，该人已被监禁，因为他曾悄悄地释放了数千名关押在拘禁营里的人。
    

泄露的材料包括 24 份文件，其中一些包含重复内容。文件包括近 200 页习近平和其他领导人的内部讲话，以及 150 多页的有关管控新疆维吾尔族人口的指示和报告。还有的提到把限制伊斯兰教的措施扩大到中国其它地方。

虽然不清楚这些文件是如何被收集和挑选的，但这次泄露意味着中国内部对镇压行动的不满比以前知道的要多。这些文件是一位要求匿名的中国政界人士泄露出来的，该人表示，希望文件的披露能防止包括习近平在内的中共领导人逃脱他们对大规模拘禁应受的责备。

中国领导人对政策制定严格保密，尤其是涉及新疆地区时。新疆资源丰富，是一个与巴基斯坦、阿富汗和中亚国家接壤的敏感边疆地区。主要是穆斯林的少数民族占新疆 2500 万人口的一半以上。这些少数民族中最大的群体是维吾尔族，他们说一种突厥语系语言，长期以来一直在文化和宗教活动上受歧视、受限制。


几十年来，北京一直试图压制维族人对中国在新疆统治的反抗。当前这轮镇压始于反政府和针对汉族的暴力事件突发之后，包括 2009 年新疆首府乌鲁木齐发生的民族骚乱，以及 2014 年 5 月，在习近平就要在北京召开为新疆制定新政策的领导人会议的前几天，在一个露天市场发生的、造成 39 人死亡的袭击事件。

自 2017 年以来，新疆当局已将数十万维吾尔族、哈萨克族和其他穆斯林关进了拘禁营。被关押的人要接受几个月、甚至几年的思想灌输和讯问，目的是将他们转化为世俗的、忠于党的支持者。

虽然这份文件建议官员告诉学生，他们的亲属由于接触了伊斯兰激进思想，正在接受 “治疗”，但同时文件的标题用了家庭成员被“处置” 的说法，“处置”是党内文件中用来表示惩罚的委婉说法。

24 份文件中，指示如何处理 2017 年暑假回新疆的少数民族学生问题的文件，提供了最详细的关于拘禁营的讨论，也是中共严格区分对内、对外做法的最明显例证。中共在对外讲述一个故事的同时，在内部用一种更严酷的叙事对官员进行动员。

自治区政府警告地方官员为返乡学生做好准备后，新疆东部城市吐鲁番的官员起草了这份问答形式的指南。随后，负责协调新疆 “维稳” 工作的部门将指南分发到新疆各地，并敦促官员们以之为样本。

政府把新疆最聪明的维族年轻人送到中国各地的大学学习，目的是培养忠于党的新一代维族公务员和教师。

这份指示显示，新疆镇压涉及的范围如此之广，甚至影响到了这些精英学生。这让当局很紧张。

“内地返乡学生社会交往广泛，涉及全国各地，” 政府在下达的指示中指出。“一旦在微信、微博等自媒体平台发表不正确言论，影响面广、消除难度大。”

这份文件警告说，学生在得知亲人的情况后，“思想产生波动的可能性很大。” 并建议便衣警察和有经验的地方干部在学生返回后尽快与他们见面，“做好人文关怀，强调有关纪律。”

这份问答形式的指示以温和的方式开始，建议官员告诉学生，“你完全不用担心” 失踪亲人的情况。

“他们在学习期间学费免费，吃住免费，并且标准比较高，” 文件指示官员这样说，官员还要说，当局为被拘禁者每天提供的伙食费在 21 元以上，“甚至超过了部分学员在家里的生活标准。”

“如果你想见一见他们的话，我们可以安排你和他们进行视频会面，” 问答以此结束。

不过，当局预计这不大可能安抚学生，因此也为一系列其他问题准备了答案，比如：我家人什么时候能毕业离校？既然是培训，他们为什么不能定期回家？我家人可以请假出来陪我吗？我家人都去学习了，家有 10 亩地，没有人种，我上学交不起学费怎么办？

指南建议对学生给出越来越坚定的回答，告诉他们，他们的家人思想上感染了伊斯兰激进主义的 “病毒”，必须接受隔离治疗。指示让官员告诉学生，就连祖父母和看起来年纪已大到不可能有暴力行为的家庭成员也不能豁免。

“如果不参加学习培训，就无法彻底全面了解宗教极端思想的危害，” 一个回答这样说，还提到了叙利亚内战和伊斯兰国的兴起。“无论年龄多大，只要思想上受到宗教极端思想的感染，都应该参加学习。”

文件说，学生们应该感谢当局带走了他们的家人。

“一定要珍惜党和政府提供的这次免费教育机会，彻底清除错误思想，并且学会汉语和就业技能，为将来你们一家人的幸福生活打好基础，” 文件指示官员这样回答学生。

当局似乎使用一个评分系统来决定能将谁从拘禁营释放出来：文件指示官员告诉学生，他们的行为可能会影响他们亲属的评分，并让官员对学生的日常行为进行评估，记录他们参加培训、会议和其他活动的情况。

“他们的家属包括你也要遵守国家的各项法律法规，不信谣，不传谣，” 文件指示官员说。“这样才能为你家人加分，符合结业标准后才能出校。”

如果学生提出拘禁给家庭经济带来影响的问题时，文件建议官员向学生保证，“你的困难党和政府将会全力帮助解决。”

不过，这份指导文件中最引人注目的，也许是为学生就被拘禁的家人提出的 “他们犯罪了吗” 的问题准备的标准答案。

文件指示官员们承认他们没有犯罪。“他们只是思想上受到了不良思想的感染，” 指示说。“只要他们思想上的‘病毒’清除了，身体健康了，就可以自由了。”

##秘密讲话

推行大规模拘禁的想法可以追溯到习近平作为中国领导人首次、也是唯一的一次新疆视察，暴力给那次视察蒙上了阴影。

2014 年，在担任国家主席一年多一点的时候，习近平对新疆进行了为期四天的视察。在行程的最后一天，两名维族激进分子在乌鲁木齐的一个火车站外制造了一个自杀式炸弹袭击，造成近 80 人受伤，一人死亡。

那次袭击的几周前，激进分子持刀在中国西南部的另一个火车站疯狂砍人，造成 31 人死亡，140 多人受伤。在习近平访问乌鲁木齐不到一个月后，袭击者向乌鲁木齐的一个菜市场投炸弹，造成 94 人受伤，至少 39 人死亡。

在这种流血事件的背景下，习近平发表了一系列秘密讲话，确定了一条强硬路线，最终形成了目前正在新疆展开的安全攻势。虽然官方媒体提到过这些讲话，但从未公布过具体内容。

不过，有四份讲话的文本在泄露出来的文件之中，它们为了解镇压的起因、以及发动这场镇压的人是怎么想的，提供了一个罕见的、未经过滤的视角。

“我们的同志拥有的手段也太简单了，” 习近平在乌鲁木齐视察反恐警队后发表的讲话中说。“所有的武器还对付不了那些大刀片子、斧头等冷兵器。”

“我们要针锋相对、毫不留情，” 他补充道。

在新疆、以及后来在北京召开的有关新疆政策的高级领导人会议上，习近平这些滔滔不绝的讲话，记录下来的是他所称为一个关键的国家安全问题的思考，以及对在新疆地区发动 “人民战争” 的思想阐述。

虽然他没有在这些讲话中下令进行大规模拘禁，但他呼吁中共动用 “专政” 工具，来铲除新疆的伊斯兰激进分子。

习近平对新疆问题表现出的关注，似乎远远超出他关于这个问题的公开讲话。他有时把伊斯兰极端主义比作病毒传播的传染病，也有时把它比作让人上瘾的危险毒品，他宣称，解决这个问题需要经过一个 “干预治疗阵痛期”。

“对宗教极端思想对人们的精神影响绝不能低估，” 习近平 2014 年 4 月 30 日在乌鲁木齐对官员们说，那是他视察新疆的最后一天。“被宗教极端思想俘获的人，无论男女老少，都变得良知泯灭、丧失人性，杀人不眨眼！”

他在一个月后在北京召开的领导人会议上，在另一次讲话中对 “宗教极端思想的毒害性” 发出警告。

“一旦信了它就像吸食了毒品一样，丧失理智、精神疯狂，什么事都干得出来，” 他说。

考虑到后来的镇压行动，习近平讲话中有几段话令人惊讶，他对官员们说，不要歧视维族人，要尊重他们的宗教信仰权利。他警告说，不要对维族人和占中国人口绝大多数的汉族人之间自然存在的摩擦做过度反应，并拒绝了想在中国彻底消灭伊斯兰教的提议。

“由于分裂势力、暴力恐怖势力都打着伊斯兰教的旗号，于是一些人认为，应该遏制伊斯兰教发展，甚至提出要消除伊斯兰教的存在，” 他在北京的那次会议上说。他称这种观点 “是片面的，甚至是错的”。

但习近平的主要观点确定无疑：他正在带领中共向加大对新疆镇压的方向急转弯。

在习近平之前，中共曾常常把新疆的袭击事件描述为少数狂热分子采取的行动，这些人受到境外鲜为人知的分裂组织的鼓动和策划。但习近平提出理由说，伊斯兰极端主义已在大部分维族社会扎下根来。

实际上，绝大多数维族人遵守适度的传统，在 20 世纪 90 年代，政府对伊斯兰教采取控制措施，但有一些人开始接受更为保守的教规，进行更公开的宗教活动。习近平的讲话表明，他对公开表示虔诚的再度盛行感到震惊。他将其归咎于宗教控制的松懈，暗示他的前任放松了警惕。

虽然以前的中国领导人强调通过经济发展来遏制新疆的动荡，但习近平说，这还不够。他要求从意识形态上解决问题，开展一场重塑该地区穆斯林少数民族思想的努力。

“毫不动摇运用人民民主专政的武器，” 习近平在有关新疆政策的领导人会议上说，那次会议是在露天市场发生致命袭击事件的六天后召开的。

##苏联的棱镜

习近平的父亲是一位早期的共产党领导人，曾在 20 世纪 80 年代支持过对少数民族的更宽松政策。一些分析人士在习近平于 2012 年 11 月担任中共中央总书记时曾预测，他可能会像父亲那样采取温和的做法。

但这些讲话强调了习近平如何透过苏联解体的棱镜来看中国面临的风险。他将苏联的解体归咎于意识形态的松懈和领导层的软弱无能。

他着手在中国各地消除对中共统治的挑战；异见人士和维权律师在一轮又一轮逮捕中消失。在新疆，他以前苏联加盟共和国为例，提出理由说，经济增长不会让社会免受种族分裂的影响。

他在那次领导人会议上说，波罗的海国家曾是苏联最发达的加盟共和国，也是苏联解体后最先离开的国家。他还说，南斯拉夫的相对繁荣也未能阻止其解体。

“我们说，发展是第一要务，是实现长治久安的基础，这是对的，” 习近平说。“但不能认为发展起来了一切问题就能迎刃而解了。”

习近平在讲话中表现出，他对维吾尔族反抗中国统治的历史、至少是北京官方版本的历史极为熟悉。他讨论了中国领导人几乎从不在公开场合提及的几件事，包括维族人在 20 世纪上半叶曾短暂自治的历史。

维族武装分子的暴力从未威胁到共产党对新疆的控制。虽然 2009 年乌鲁木齐发生民族骚乱，造成近 200 人死亡后，更致命的袭击事件有所增加，但规模仍相对较小，地点相对分散，手段也相对简单。

尽管如此，习近平警告说，暴力正从新疆蔓延到中国其它地区，可能会损害共产党不可动摇的形象。习近平在领导人会议上说，如果不消除这种威胁，“社会稳定就会受到冲击，各族人民大团结就会受到破坏，改革发展稳定大局就会受到影响。”

他把外交考虑放在一边，称新疆伊斯兰极端主义的根源在中东，并警告说，叙利亚和阿富汗的动荡将加大中国面临的风险。他说，维族人已前往这两个国家，他们可能会变成经验丰富的战士，回中国来寻求建立他们称之为东突厥斯坦的独立家园。

“美国从阿富汗撤军以后，盘踞在阿巴边境的暴力恐怖组织可能很快向中亚渗透，” 习近平说。“在叙利亚、阿富汗等地接受实战化训练的‘东突’恐怖组织人员随时可能在新疆发动暴力恐怖活动。”

习近平的前任胡锦涛对 2009 年乌鲁木齐发生的骚乱采取了镇压的做法，但胡锦涛也强调，经济发展是解决少数民族不满的良方——这是中共的长期政策。但习近平在讲话中发出信号，要采取与胡锦涛不同的做法。

“新疆这些年发展速度很快、人民生活水平不断提高，但民族分子分裂活动和暴力恐怖活动仍然呈上升，” 他说。“这说明，经济发展并不能自然而然带来长治久安。”

习近平指出，确保新疆稳定，需要有大规模的监视和情报收集工作，以根除维族社会中的反抗力量。

他说，新技术必须成为解决方案的一部分，预示了中共在新疆大范围使用人脸识别、基因检测和大数据等技术的做法。但他也强调了使用社区告密者等老方法，并敦促官员们研究美国人是怎样应对 9·11 袭击事件的。

他说，像美国那样，中国也 “必须把民众当作保护国家安全的重要资源”。

“打人民战争，应该是我们共产党人的拿手好戏，” 他说。“我们最善于做组织起来的工作。”

这些讲话中，对习近平展望的、如今已成为镇压行动核心的拘禁营的唯一暗示是，他赞成在新疆的监狱进行更激烈的思想灌输。

“要做好犯罪人员教育改造和转化工作，” 他视察新疆南部的第二天对当地官员说。“就是将来这些人放出来也要继续教育转化。”

几个月后，新疆各地开始出现再教育营，最初大多是小型设施，一次只能容纳数十名或数百名维族人，再教育的目的是迫使他们放弃对伊斯兰教的忠诚，表达对共产党的感激之情。

后来，政府在 2016 年 8 月把一个叫陈全国的强硬派人物从西藏调去治理新疆。几周后，他把地方官员召集起来，围绕着习近平的目标 “再动员”，他宣称习近平的讲话 “为进一步做好新疆工作指明了方向”。

接下来的是，新的安全控制措施和再教育营迅速扩大。

“反恐维稳斗争是一场持久战，也是一场攻坚战，” 陈全国在 2017 年 10 月对新疆地区领导人的一次演讲中说。

镇压似乎遏制了新疆的暴力骚乱，但许多专家警告说，极端的安全措施和大规模的拘禁可能会滋生怨恨情绪，最终可能会引发更严重的民族冲突。

这些拘禁营已在华盛顿和其他国家的首都遭到了谴责。不过，早在 2014 年 5 月的领导人会议上，习近平就预料到了国际社会的批评，并在非公开场合敦促官员们，不要理会这些批评。

“不要怕敌对势力说三道四，也不要怕敌对势力抹黑新疆形象，” 他说。

##“应收尽收”


泄露出来的文件显示，中共内部对这次镇压的抵制情绪比以前所知的要多，也凸显了新疆的新党委书记在克服抵制上所起的关键作用。

陈全国领导的这场运动，更像是毛泽东发动的激烈政治运动。在陈全国的运动中，施加在地方官员身上的自上而下的压力，鼓励他们采取过度措施，而且，任何怀疑的表示都被视为犯罪行为。

2017 年 2 月，陈全国在乌鲁木齐一个巨大的广场上，对数千名立正站着的警官和军人说，要为一场 “粉碎性打击、毁灭性打击” 做准备。文件显示，在接下来的几周里，领导层选定了大规模拘禁维族人的方案。

陈全国发布了一条影响广泛的命令：“应收尽收”。这个模糊说法自 2017 年开始，不断出现在内部文件中。

以前，中共曾在要求官员在收税或统计粮食产量做到谨慎全面时，使用过 “应收尽收” 一词。现在，这个词被用在收人的指示中，用在对任何表现出宗教激进情绪或反政府观点 “症状” 的人进行拘禁、只字不提司法程序的命令里。

当局给出了几十种这种症状的表现，包括虔诚的维族人常见的做法，比如留长胡子、戒烟戒酒、学习阿拉伯语，以及在清真寺外祈祷。

中共领导人对海外恐怖主义事件和中国可能发生类似的袭击发出警告，以强化命令。

例如，2017 年 6 月，时任新疆最高安全官员的朱海仑签署了一份长达 10 页的指示，把英国前不久发生的恐怖袭击为 “对我们的警示”，并说要 “举一反三，引以为戒”。这份文件指责英国政府 “过分强调‘人权高于安全’ , 对互联网和现实社会宣扬极端主义的管控力度不够。”

文件还批评了新疆的安全疏漏，包括调查不彻底、监视设备出故障，以及没有将涉嫌可疑行为的人抓起来。

文件下令继续拘留这些人。“坚持应收尽收，” 文件说。“有了就收。”

究竟有多少人被关进了拘禁营仍是一个被严格保守的秘密。但泄露的文件中有一份对这场行动的规模有所暗示：文件指示官员应防止传染病在拥挤的设施中传播。

##“擅自作主”


这些命令下达到莎车县时尤为紧迫，也引发了争议。莎车县位于新疆南部，由乡镇和村庄组成，那里的 90 万居民几乎全部是维族人。

习近平在 2014 年的讲话中专门提到，南疆是打击宗教极端主义的前线。维族在南疆人口中占近 90%，而在新疆总人口中占不到一半。习近平制定了吸引更多汉族人来南疆定居的长期目标。

文件显示，习近平和其他中共领导人下令给新疆生产建设兵团这个准军事组织，令其加快让更多汉族人在南疆定居的努力。

据政府报告称，几个月后，100 多名手持斧头和长刀的维族武装分子，袭击了莎车县的一个政府办公室和警察局，造成 37 人死亡。报告说，安全部队在战斗中击毙了 59 名袭击者。

不久后，一位名叫王勇智的官员被任命负责管理莎车县。他戴着眼镜，留着平头，看上去是一个典型的技术官僚。他在南疆长大，全部职业生涯都在那里度过。他被看作是一位娴熟的、经验丰富的干部，能够完成中共在该地区的首要任务：经济发展和严格控制维族人。

但这些泄露的文件中有两份极为发人深省的报告，它们描述了王勇智倒台的原因，其中一份 11 页，是中共对王勇智进行内部调查的总结，另一份 15 页，是王勇智可能被迫所写的认罪书。这两份文件都在党内做了分发，以警告官员在这场镇压中严格执行党的路线。

王勇智这样的汉族官员在南疆起着党的顶梁柱的作用，他们负责监管级别更低的维族官员。王勇智也似乎得到了高层领导人的赞赏，包括 2015 年访问过南疆的、时任中国最高民族问题官员的俞正声。

王勇智上任后加强了莎车县的安全措施，但他为了解决民族不满情绪，也推动了经济发展。他还试图软化中共的宗教政策，宣称在家里有《古兰经》没有错，并鼓励中共官员读《古兰经》，以更好地了解维族传统。

大规模拘禁开始时，王勇智最初是按照指示去做的，似乎还表现出对这项任务的热情。

他建起了两个庞大的新拘留设施，其中一个有 50 个篮球场那么大，并把两万人关进了拘禁营。

2017 年，他大幅提高了安全部队的拨款，将花在检查站和监视等方面的开支增加了一倍多，达到 13.7 亿元人民币。

他把党员召集到一个公共广场开大会，敦促他们抓紧打击恐怖分子的工作。“坚决打干净，打彻底，” 他说。“斩草除根。”

但据后来有他本人签名的认罪书，王勇智私下里对这些做法有顾虑。他的认罪书应该已经经过了中共的仔细审查。

他在防止莎车县再次发生暴力事件上承受着巨大的压力，他担心镇压可能会引发反弹。

当局为新疆部分地区设置了拘禁维族人的数字目标，虽然不清楚莎车县是否也有目标，但王勇智觉得，拘禁的命令没有给任何适度的做法留下余地，会毒害该县的民族关系。

他还担心，大规模拘禁将让他无法实现他获得晋升所需的经济发展。

领导层已制定了减少新疆贫困的目标。但由于这么多工作年龄的居民被关进了拘禁营，王勇智担心，这些目标将无法实现，这会让他对一份更好的工作的期望成为泡影。

他写道，他的上级领导 “好高骛远，不切实际”。

“上级的决策部署与基层实际差距大，不能照搬照套，” 他还说。

为了执行南疆的镇压任务，陈全国从北疆调来了数百名官员。在公开场合，王勇智对莎车县调来的 62 人表示欢迎。私下里，他很生气，抱怨新来的人不知道怎样与当地官员和居民一起工作。

新疆官员面临着拘禁维族人、防止发生新暴力事件的持续不断的压力。王勇智在认罪书中说，他在工作时喝酒。他描述了在一次维稳会议上醉倒的一幕。想必他是在受压力之下才在忏悔录上签了字。

“下午会议汇报工作时语无伦次，” 他写道。“刚说了两三句，便一头栽到桌子上，成为全地区最大的笑话。”

数千名新疆官员因抵制或未能以足够的狂热执行镇压而受到了惩罚。文件显示，维族官员被指责保护维吾尔族人，南疆地区另一个县的汉族领导人谷文胜被关入狱，因为他试图对拘禁采取拖延的做法，还庇护维族官员。

秘密调查小组走遍了该地区，寻找那些做得不够的人。官方数据显示，2017 年，中共对新疆党员在 “反分裂斗争” 中的违法行为展开了逾 1.2 万起调查，是上一年的 20 多倍。

王勇智可能比其他任何官员都走得更远。

他下令悄悄释放了拘禁营中关押的 7000 多人，这一挑衅行为导致他被拘留，被剥夺了权力，并受到起诉。

“在执行自治区党委‘应收尽收’要求中，打折扣，做选择，搞变通，认为收多了会人为制造矛盾，增加抵触情绪，” 王勇智写道。

“我在各类会议上反复强调‘应收尽收’不是全部收押，擅自作主将全县已收押收教 2 万余人中的 7000 余人违规解押解教，” 他补充道。

##公然对抗


2017 年 9 月后，王勇智从公众视野中默默地消失了。

大约六个月后，中共以儆效尤，对他进行公开惩罚，宣布对他立案调查，罪名是 “严重违背党中央治疆方略”。

总结调查结果的内部报告写得更直接了当。“本应鞠躬尽瘁为党工作，” 报告说。

“可他却无视党中央治疆方略和自治区党委员会决策部署，甚至公然对抗。”

这份报告和王勇智的认罪书都在会上被读给了新疆各地的官员们听。传递给他们的信息很清楚：中共不会容忍在执行大规模拘禁中的任何犹豫。

宣传机构把王勇智描述为腐败到无可救药的程度，内部报告指责他在建筑和矿业交易中收受贿赂，并向上级行贿以获得提升。

当局还强调说，他不是维族人的朋友。为了实现减少贫困的目标，据说他曾迫使 1500 个家庭在寒冷的冬天搬到没有暖气的公寓里去。他在认罪书中说，一些村民为了取暖，在室内烧柴，导致了人员伤亡。

但当局并没有告诉公众王勇智最大的政治罪，而是将其隐藏在内部报告中。

内部报告说，他 “拒不执行自治区党委‘应收尽收’的要求。”

#THE XINJIANG PAPERS
#‘Absolutely No Mercy’: Leaked Files Expose How China Organized Mass Detentions of Muslims

More than 400 pages of internal Chinese documents provide an unprecedented inside look at the crackdown on ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region.

BY AUSTIN RAMZY AND CHRIS BUCKLEY
NOVEMBER 16, 2019

**HONG KONG —** The students booked their tickets home at the end of the semester, hoping for a relaxing break after exams and a summer of happy reunions with family in China’s far west.

Instead, they would soon be told that their parents were gone, relatives had vanished and neighbors were missing — all of them locked up in an expanding network of detention camps built to hold Muslim ethnic minorities.

The authorities in the Xinjiang region worried the situation was a powder keg. And so they prepared.

The leadership distributed a classified directive advising local officials to corner returning students as soon as they arrived and keep them quiet. It included a chillingly bureaucratic guide for how to handle their anguished questions, beginning with the most obvious: Where is my family?

“**They’re in a training school set up by the government,**” the prescribed answer began. If pressed, officials were to tell students that their relatives were not criminals — yet could not leave these “schools.”

The question-and-answer script also included a **barely concealed threat**: Students were to be told that their behavior could either shorten or extend the detention of their relatives.

“**I’m sure that you will support them, because this is for their own good,**” officials were advised to say, “**and also for your own good.**”

​

The directive was among 403 pages of internal documents that have been shared with The New York Times in one of the most significant leaks of government papers from inside China’s ruling Communist Party in decades. They provide an unprecedented inside view of the [continuing clampdown in Xinjiang, in which the authorities have corralled as many as a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others into internment camps and prisons](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html) over the past three years.

The party has [rejected international criticism of the camps and described them as job-training centers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/world/asia/china-xinjiang.html) that use mild methods to fight Islamic extremism. But the documents confirm the coercive nature of the crackdown in the words and orders of the very officials who conceived and orchestrated it.

Even as the government presented its efforts in Xinjiang to the public as benevolent and unexceptional, it discussed and organized a ruthless and extraordinary campaign in these internal communications. Senior party leaders are recorded ordering drastic and urgent action against extremist violence, including the mass detentions, and discussing the consequences with cool detachment.

Children saw their parents taken away, students wondered who would pay their tuition and crops could not be planted or harvested for lack of manpower, the reports noted. Yet officials were directed to tell people who complained to be grateful for the Communist Party’s help and stay quiet.

The leaked papers offer a striking picture of how the hidden machinery of the Chinese state carried out the country’s most far-reaching internment campaign since the Mao era. The key disclosures in the documents include:

• President Xi Jinping, the party chief, laid the groundwork for the crackdown in a series of speeches delivered in private to officials during and after a visit to Xinjiang in April 2014, just weeks after Uighur militants [stabbed more than 150 people at a train station](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/world/asia/china-executes-3-over-deadly-knife-attack-at-train-station-in-2014.html), killing 31. Mr. Xi called for an all-out “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism” using the “organs of dictatorship,” and showing “absolutely no mercy.”

• Terrorist attacks abroad and the drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan heightened the leadership’s fears and helped shape the crackdown. Officials argued that attacks in Britain resulted from policies that put “human rights above security,” and Mr. Xi urged the party to emulate aspects of America’s “war on terror” after the Sept. 11 attacks.

• The internment camps in Xinjiang expanded rapidly after the appointment in August 2016 of Chen Quanguo, a zealous new party boss for the region. He distributed Mr. Xi’s speeches to justify the campaign and exhorted officials to “round up everyone who should be rounded up.”

• The crackdown encountered doubts and resistance from local officials who feared it would exacerbate ethnic tensions and stifle economic growth. Mr. Chen responded by purging officials suspected of standing in his way, including one county leader who was jailed after quietly releasing thousands of inmates from the camps.

The leaked papers consist of 24 documents, some of which contain duplicated material. They include nearly 200 pages of internal speeches by Mr. Xi and other leaders, and more than 150 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance and control of the Uighur population in Xinjiang. There are also references to plans to extend restrictions on Islam to other parts of China.

Though it is unclear how the documents were gathered and selected, the leak suggests greater discontent inside the party apparatus over the crackdown than previously known. The papers were brought to light by a member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity and expressed hope that their disclosure would prevent party leaders, including Mr. Xi, from escaping culpability for the mass detentions.

The Chinese leadership wraps policymaking in secrecy, especially when it comes to Xinjiang, a resource-rich territory located on the sensitive frontier with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. Predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups make up more than half the region’s population of 25 million. The largest of these groups are the Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language and have long faced discrimination and restrictions on cultural and religious activities.

Beijing has sought for decades to suppress Uighur resistance to Chinese rule in Xinjiang. The current crackdown began after a surge of antigovernment and anti-Chinese violence, including [ethnic riots in 2009 in Urumqi](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/world/asia/18xinjiang.html), the regional capital, and a May 2014 [attack on an outdoor market that killed 39 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/world/asia/8-sentenced-to-death-for-terrorist-attacks-in-western-china.html) just days before Mr. Xi convened a leadership conference in Beijing to set a new policy course for Xinjiang.

Since 2017, the authorities in Xinjiang have detained many hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in internment camps. Inmates undergo months or years of indoctrination and interrogation aimed at transforming them into secular and loyal supporters of the party.

Of the 24 documents, the directive on how to handle minority students returning home to Xinjiang in the summer of 2017 offers the most detailed discussion of the indoctrination camps — and the clearest illustration of the regimented way the party told the public one story while mobilizing around a much harsher narrative internally.

Even as the document advises officials to inform students that their relatives are receiving “treatment” for exposure to radical Islam, its title refers to family members who are being “dealt with,” or chuzhi, a euphemism used in party documents to mean punishment.

Officials in Turpan, a city in eastern Xinjiang, drafted the question-and-answer script after the regional government warned local officials to prepare for the returning students. The agency coordinating efforts to “maintain stability” across Xinjiang then distributed the guide across the region and urged officials to use it as a model.

The government sends Xinjiang’s brightest young Uighurs to universities across China, with the goal of training a new generation of Uighur civil servants and teachers loyal to the party.

The crackdown has been so extensive that it affected even these elite students, the directive shows. And that made the authorities nervous.

“Returning students from other parts of China have widespread social ties across the entire country,” the directive noted. “The moment they issue incorrect opinions on WeChat, Weibo and other social media platforms, the impact is widespread and difficult to eradicate.”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc2-highlight-01.jpg)

The document warned that there was a “**serious possibility**” students might sink into “**turmoil**” after learning what had happened to their relatives. It recommended that police officers in plain clothes and experienced local officials meet them as soon as they returned “to show humane concern and stress the rules.”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc2-highlight-02.jpg)

The directive’s question-and-answer guide begins gently, with officials advised to tell the students that they have “**absolutely no need to worry**” about relatives who have disappeared.

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc2-highlight-03.jpg)

“**Tuition for their period of study is free and so are food and living costs, and the standards are quite high,**” officials were told to say, before adding that the authorities were spending more than $3 per day on meals for each detainee, “**even better than the living standards that some students have back home.**”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc2-highlight-04.jpg)

“**If you want to see them,**” the answer concluded, “**we can arrange for you to have a video meeting.**”

​

The authorities anticipated, however, that this was unlikely to mollify students and provided replies to a series of other questions: When will my relatives be released? If this is for training, why can’t they come home? Can they request a leave? How will I afford school if my parents are studying and there is no one to work on the farm?

The guide recommended increasingly firm replies telling the students that their relatives had been “infected” by the “virus” of Islamic radicalism and must be quarantined and cured. Even grandparents and family members who seemed too old to carry out violence could not be spared, officials were directed to say.

“If they don’t undergo study and training, they’ll never thoroughly and fully understand the dangers of religious extremism,” one answer said, citing the civil war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State. “No matter what age, anyone who has been infected by religious extremism must undergo study.”

Students should be grateful that the authorities had taken their relatives away, the document said.

“Treasure this chance for free education that the party and government has provided to thoroughly eradicate erroneous thinking, and also learn Chinese and job skills,” one answer said. “This offers a great foundation for a happy life for your family.”

The authorities appear to be using a scoring system to determine who can be released from the camps: The document instructed officials to tell the students that their behavior could hurt their relatives’ scores, and to assess the daily behavior of the students and record their attendance at training sessions, meetings and other activities.

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc3-highlight-01.jpg)

“**Family members, including you, must abide by the state’s laws and rules, and not believe or spread rumors,**” officials were told to say. “**Only then can you add points for your family member, and after a period of assessment they can leave the school if they meet course completion standards.**”

If asked about the impact of the detentions on family finances, officials were advised to assure students that “**the party and the government will do everything possible to ease your hardships.**”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc3-highlight-03.jpg)

The line that stands out most in the script, however, may be the model answer for how to respond to students who ask of their detained relatives, “**Did they commit a crime?**”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc3-highlight-04.jpg)

The document instructed officials to acknowledge that they had not. “**It is just that their thinking has been infected by unhealthy thoughts,**” the script said.

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc3-highlight-05.jpg)

“**Freedom is only possible when this ‘virus’ in their thinking is eradicated and they are in good health.**”

​

The ideas driving the mass detentions can be traced back to Xi Jinping’s first and only visit to Xinjiang as China’s leader, a tour shadowed by violence.

In 2014, little more than a year after becoming president, he spent four days in the region, and on the last day of the trip, two Uighur militants staged a suicide bombing outside a train station in Urumqi that injured nearly 80 people, one fatally.

Weeks earlier, militants with knives had gone on a rampage at another railway station, in southwest China, killing 31 people and injuring more than 140. And less than a month after Mr. Xi’s visit, assailants tossed explosives into a vegetable market in Urumqi, wounding 94 people and killing at least 39.

Against this backdrop of bloodshed, Mr. Xi delivered a series of secret speeches setting the hard-line course that culminated in the security offensive now underway in Xinjiang. While state media have alluded to these speeches, none were made public.

The text of four of them, though, were among the leaked documents — and they provide a rare, unfiltered look at the origins of the crackdown and the beliefs of the man who set it in motion.

“The methods that our comrades have at hand are too primitive,” Mr. Xi said in one talk, after inspecting a counterterrorism police squad in Urumqi. “None of these weapons is any answer for their big machete blades, ax heads and cold steel weapons.”

“We must be as harsh as them,” he added, “and show absolutely no mercy.”

In free-flowing monologues in Xinjiang and at a subsequent leadership conference on Xinjiang policy in Beijing, Mr. Xi is recorded thinking through what he called a crucial national security issue and laying out his ideas for a “people’s war” in the region.

Although he did not order mass detentions in these speeches, he called on the party to unleash the tools of “dictatorship” to eradicate radical Islam in Xinjiang.

Mr. Xi displayed a fixation with the issue that seemed to go well beyond his public remarks on the subject. He likened Islamic extremism alternately to a virus-like contagion and a dangerously addictive drug, and declared that addressing it would require “a period of painful, interventionary treatment.”

“The psychological impact of extremist religious thought on people must never be underestimated,” Mr. Xi told officials in Urumqi on April 30, 2014, the final day of his trip to Xinjiang. “People who are captured by religious extremism — male or female, old or young — have their consciences destroyed, lose their humanity and murder without blinking an eye.”

In another speech, at the leadership conclave in Beijing a month later, he warned of “the toxicity of religious extremism.”

“As soon as you believe in it,” he said, “it’s like taking a drug, and you lose your sense, go crazy and will do anything.”

In several surprising passages, given the crackdown that followed, Mr. Xi also told officials to not discriminate against Uighurs and to respect their right to worship. He warned against overreacting to natural friction between Uighurs and Han Chinese, the nation’s dominant ethnic group, and rejected proposals to try to eliminate Islam entirely in China.

“In light of separatist and terrorist forces under the banner of Islam, some people have argued that Islam should be restricted or even eradicated,” he said during the Beijing conference. He called that view “biased, even wrong.”

But Mr. Xi’s main point was unmistakable: He was leading the party in a sharp turn toward greater repression in Xinjiang.

Before Mr. Xi, the party had often described attacks in Xinjiang as the work of a few fanatics inspired and orchestrated by shadowy separatist groups abroad. But Mr. Xi argued that Islamic extremism had taken root across swaths of Uighur society.

In fact, the vast majority of Uighurs adhere to moderate traditions, though some began embracing more conservative and more public religious practices in the 1990s, despite state controls on Islam. Mr. Xi’s remarks suggest he was alarmed by the revival of public piety. He blamed lax controls on religion, suggesting that his predecessors had let down their guard.

While previous Chinese leaders emphasized economic development to stifle unrest in Xinjiang, Mr. Xi said that was not enough. He demanded an ideological cure, an effort to rewire the thinking of the region’s Muslim minorities.

“The weapons of the people’s democratic dictatorship must be wielded without any hesitation or wavering,” Mr. Xi told the leadership conference on Xinjiang policy, which convened six days after the deadly attack on the vegetable market.

Mr. Xi is the [son of an early Communist Party leader](https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/china-venerates-a-revolutionary-the-father-of-its-new-leader/) who in the 1980s supported more relaxed policies toward ethnic minority groups, and some analysts had expected he might follow his father’s milder ways when he [assumed leadership of the party in November 2012](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/world/asia/communists-conclude-party-congress-in-china.html).

But the speeches underscore how Mr. Xi sees risks to China through the prism of the collapse of the Soviet Union, which he blamed on ideological laxity and spineless leadership.

Across China, he set about eliminating challenges to party rule; dissidents and [human rights lawyers disappeared in waves of arrests](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/world/asia/china-wang-quanzhang-human-rights.html). In Xinjiang, he pointed to examples from the former Soviet bloc to argue that economic growth would not immunize a society against ethnic separatism.

The Baltic republics were among the most developed in the Soviet Union but also the first to leave when the country broke up, he told the leadership conference. Yugoslavia’s relative prosperity did not prevent its disintegration either, he added.

“We say that development is the top priority and the basis for achieving lasting security, and that’s right,” Mr. Xi said. “But it would be wrong to believe that with development every problem solves itself.”

In the speeches, Mr. Xi showed a deep familiarity with the history of Uighur resistance to Chinese rule, or at least Beijing’s official version of it, and discussed episodes rarely if ever mentioned by Chinese leaders in public, including brief periods of Uighur self-rule in the first half of the 20th century.

Violence by Uighur militants has never threatened Communist control of the region. Though attacks grew deadlier after 2009, when nearly 200 people died in ethnic riots in Urumqi, they remained relatively small, scattered and unsophisticated.

Even so, Mr. Xi warned that the violence was spilling from Xinjiang into other parts of China and could taint the party’s image of strength. Unless the threat was extinguished, Mr. Xi told the leadership conference, “social stability will suffer shocks, the general unity of people of every ethnicity will be damaged, and the broad outlook for reform, development and stability will be affected.”

Setting aside diplomatic niceties, he traced the origins of Islamic extremism in Xinjiang to the Middle East, and warned that turmoil in Syria and Afghanistan would magnify the risks for China. Uighurs had traveled to both countries, he said, and could return to China as seasoned fighters seeking an independent homeland, which they called East Turkestan.

“After the United States pulls troops out of Afghanistan, terrorist organizations positioned on the frontiers of Afghanistan and Pakistan may quickly infiltrate into Central Asia,” Mr. Xi said. “East Turkestan’s terrorists who have received real-war training in Syria and Afghanistan could at any time launch terrorist attacks in Xinjiang.”

Mr. Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, responded to the 2009 riots in Urumqi with a clampdown but he also stressed economic development as a cure for ethnic discontent — longstanding party policy. But Mr. Xi signaled a break with Mr. Hu’s approach in the speeches.

“In recent years, Xinjiang has grown very quickly and the standard of living has consistently risen, but even so ethnic separatism and terrorist violence have still been on the rise,” he said. “This goes to show that economic development does not automatically bring lasting order and security.”

Ensuring stability in Xinjiang would require a sweeping campaign of surveillance and intelligence gathering to root out resistance in Uighur society, Mr. Xi argued.

He said new technology must be part of the solution, foreshadowing the party’s deployment of facial recognition, genetic testing and big data in Xinjiang. But he also emphasized old-fashioned methods, such as neighborhood informants, and urged officials to study how Americans responded to the Sept. 11 attacks.

Like the United States, he said, China “must make the public an important resource in protecting national security.”

“We Communists should be naturals at fighting a people’s war,” he said. “We’re the best at organizing for a task.”

The only suggestion in these speeches that Mr. Xi envisioned the internment camps now at the heart of the crackdown was an endorsement of more intense indoctrination programs in Xinjiang’s prisons.

“There must be effective educational remolding and transformation of criminals,” he told officials in southern Xinjiang on the second day of his trip. “And even after these people are released, their education and transformation must continue.”

Within months, indoctrination sites began opening across Xinjiang — mostly small facilities at first, which held dozens or hundreds of Uighurs at a time for sessions intended to pressure them into disavowing devotion to Islam and professing gratitude for the party.

Then in August 2016, a hard-liner named Chen Quanguo was transferred from Tibet to govern Xinjiang. Within weeks, he called on local officials to “remobilize” around Mr. Xi’s goals and declared that Mr. Xi’s speeches “set the direction for making a success of Xinjiang.”

New security controls and a drastic expansion of the indoctrination camps followed.

“**The struggle against terror and to safeguard stability is a protracted war, and also a war of offense,**” Mr. Chen said in a speech to the regional leadership in October 2017 that was among the leaked papers.

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc4-highlight-02.jpg)

In another document, a record of his remarks in a video conference in August 2017, he cited “**vocational skills, education training and transformation centers**” as an example of “**good practices**” for achieving Mr. Xi’s goals for Xinjiang.

​

The crackdown appears to have smothered violent unrest in Xinjiang, but many experts have warned that the extreme security measures and mass detentions are likely to breed resentment that could eventually inspire worse ethnic clashes.

The camps have been condemned in Washington and other foreign capitals. As early as the May 2014 leadership conference, though, Mr. Xi anticipated international criticism and urged officials behind closed doors to ignore it.

“Don’t be afraid if hostile forces whine, or if hostile forces malign the image of Xinjiang,” he said.

The documents show there was more resistance to the crackdown inside the party than previously known — and highlight the key role that the new party boss in Xinjiang played in overcoming it.

Mr. Chen led a campaign akin to one of Mao’s turbulent political crusades, in which top-down pressure on local officials encouraged overreach and any expression of doubt was treated as a crime.

In February 2017, he told thousands of police officers and troops standing at attention in a vast square in Urumqi to prepare for a “smashing, obliterating offensive.” In the following weeks, the documents indicate, the leadership settled on plans to detain Uighurs in large numbers.

Mr. Chen issued a sweeping order: “Round up everyone who should be rounded up.” The vague phrase appears repeatedly in internal documents from 2017.

The party had previously used the phrase — “ying shou jin shou” in Chinese — when demanding that officials be vigilant and comprehensive in collecting taxes or measuring harvests. Now it was being applied to humans in directives that ordered, with no mention of judicial procedures, the detention of anyone who displayed “symptoms” of religious radicalism or antigovernment views.

The authorities laid out dozens of such signs, including common behavior among devout Uighurs such as wearing long beards, giving up smoking or drinking, studying Arabic and praying outside mosques.

Party leaders reinforced the orders with warnings about terrorism abroad and potential copycat attacks in China.

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc5-highlight-01.jpg)

For example, a 10-page directive in June 2017 signed by Zhu Hailun, then Xinjiang’s top security official, called recent terrorist attacks in Britain “**a warning and a lesson for us.**” It blamed the British government’s “excessive emphasis on ‘human rights above security,’ and inadequate controls on the propagation of extremism on the internet and in society.”

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc5-highlight-02.jpg)

It also complained of security lapses in Xinjiang, including sloppy investigations, malfunctions in surveillance equipment and the failure to hold people accused of suspicious behavior.

![](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/10/21/xinjiang-article/13c819960fa0d589a50c0179792cdbf8c4b72c5b/doc5-highlight-03.jpg)

Keep up the detentions, it ordered. “**Stick to rounding up everyone who should be rounded up,**” it said. “**If they’re there, round them up.**”

​

The number of people swept into the camps remains a closely guarded secret. But one of the leaked documents offers a hint of the scale of the campaign: It instructed officials to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in crowded facilities.

The orders were especially urgent and contentious in Yarkand County, a collection of rural towns and villages in southern Xinjiang where nearly all of the 900,000 residents are Uighur.

In the 2014 speeches, Mr. Xi had singled out southern Xinjiang as the front line in his fight against religious extremism. Uighurs make up close to 90 percent of the population in the south, compared to just under half in Xinjiang over all, and Mr. Xi set a long-term goal of attracting more Han Chinese settlers.

He and other party leaders ordered a quasi-military organization, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, to accelerate efforts to settle the area with more Han Chinese, the documents show.

A few months later, more than 100 Uighur militants armed with axes and knives [attacked a government office and police station in Yarkand](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/world/asia/china-says-nearly-100-are-killed-in-week-of-unrest-in-xinjiang.html), killing 37 people, according to government reports. In the battle, the security forces shot dead 59 assailants, the reports said.

An official named Wang Yongzhi was appointed to run Yarkand soon afterward. With his glasses and crew cut, he looked the picture of a party technocrat. He had grown up and spent his career in southern Xinjiang and was seen as a deft, seasoned official who could deliver on the party’s top priorities in the area: economic development and firm control of the Uighurs.

But among the most revealing documents in the leaked papers are two that describe Mr. Wang’s downfall — an 11-page report summarizing the party’s internal investigation into his actions, and the text of a 15-page confession that he may have given under duress. Both were distributed inside the party as a warning to officials to fall in line behind the crackdown.

Han officials like Mr. Wang serve as the party’s anchors in southern Xinjiang, watching over Uighur officials in more junior positions, and he seemed to enjoy the blessing of top leaders, including Yu Zhengsheng, then China’s most senior official for ethnic issues, who visited the county in 2015.

Mr. Wang set about beefing up security in Yarkand but he also pushed economic development to address ethnic discontent. And he sought to soften the party’s religious policies, declaring that there was nothing wrong with having a Quran at home and encouraging party officials to read it to better understand Uighur traditions.

When the mass detentions began, Mr. Wang did as he was told at first and appeared to embrace the task with zeal.

He built two sprawling new detention facilities, including one as big as 50 basketball courts, and herded 20,000 people into them.

He sharply increased funding for the security forces in 2017, more than doubling spending on outlays such as checkpoints and surveillance to 1.37 billion renminbi, or about $180 million.

And he lined up party members for a rally in a public square and urged them to press the fight against terrorists. “Wipe them out completely,” he said. “Destroy them root and branch.”

But privately, Mr. Wang had misgivings, according to the confession that he later signed, which would have been carefully vetted by the party.

He was under intense pressure to prevent an outburst of violence in Yarkand, and worried the crackdown would provoke a backlash.

The authorities set numeric targets for Uighur detentions in parts of Xinjiang, and while it is unclear if they did so in Yarkand, Mr. Wang felt the orders left no room for moderation and would poison ethnic relations in the county.

He also worried that the mass detentions would make it impossible to record the economic progress he needed to earn a promotion.

The leadership had set goals to reduce poverty in Xinjiang. But with so many working-age residents being sent to the camps, Mr. Wang was afraid the targets would be out of reach, along with his hopes for a better job.

His superiors, he wrote, were “overly ambitious and unrealistic.”

“The policies and measures taken by higher levels were at gaping odds with realities on the ground and could not be implemented in full,” he added.

To help enforce the crackdown in southern Xinjiang, Mr. Chen transferred in hundreds of officials from the north. Publicly, Mr. Wang welcomed the 62 assigned to Yarkand. Privately, he seethed that they did not understand how to work with local officials and residents.

The pressure on officials in Xinjiang to detain Uighurs and prevent fresh violence was relentless, and Mr. Wang said in the confession — presumably signed under pressure — that he drank on the job. He described one episode in which he collapsed drunk during a meeting on security.

“While reporting on my work in the afternoon meeting, I rambled incoherently,” he said. “I’d just spoken a few sentences and my head collapsed on the table. It became the biggest joke across the whole prefecture.”

Thousands of officials in Xinjiang were punished for resisting or failing to carry out the crackdown with sufficient zeal. Uighur officials were accused of protecting fellow Uighurs, and Gu Wensheng, the Han leader of another southern county, was jailed for trying to slow the detentions and shield Uighur officials, according to the documents.

Secret teams of investigators traveled across the region identifying those who were not doing enough. In 2017, the party opened more than 12,000 investigations into party members in Xinjiang for infractions in the “fight against separatism,” more than 20 times the figure in the previous year, according to official statistics.

Mr. Wang may have gone further than any other official.

Quietly, he ordered the release of more than 7,000 camp inmates — an act of defiance for which he would be detained, stripped of power and prosecuted.

“**I undercut, acted selectively and made my own adjustments, believing that rounding up so many people would knowingly fan conflict and deepen resentment**,” Mr. Wang wrote.

“**Without approval and on my own initiative**,” he added, “**I broke the rules.**”

Mr. Wang quietly disappeared from public view after September 2017.

About six months later, the party made an example of him, announcing that he was being investigated for “gravely disobeying the party central leadership’s strategy for governing Xinjiang.”

The internal report on the investigation was more direct. “He should have given his all to serving the party,” it said. “Instead, he ignored the party central leadership’s strategy for Xinjiang, and he went as far as brazen defiance.”

Both the report and Mr. Wang’s confession were read aloud to officials across Xinjiang. The message was plain: The party would not tolerate any hesitation in carrying out the mass detentions.

Propaganda outlets described Mr. Wang as irredeemably corrupt, and the internal report accused him of taking bribes on construction and mining deals and paying off superiors to win promotions.

The authorities also emphasized he was no friend of Uighurs. To hit poverty-reduction targets, he was said to have forced 1,500 families to move into unheated apartments in the middle of the winter. Some villagers burned wood indoors to keep warm, leading to injuries and deaths, his confession said.

But Mr. Wang’s greatest political sin was not revealed to the public. Instead, the authorities hid it in the internal report.

“He refused,” it said, “to round up everyone who should be rounded up.”
